        <h1 style="font-size:40px">VIGENERE CIPHER</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center">This cipher is a generalized <a href="caesar.html">Caesar Cipher</a>.
        Instead of having a single shift as the key, the key consists of many shifts. So, a key of <code>abc</code> would leave every third letter starting from the first unchanged, shift every third letter starting from the second by 1, and shift every third letter starting from the third by 2.
        This makes this cipher much harder to break than the Caesar Cipher. Shorter key lengths make the cipher vulnerable to a possible cryptanalysis attack. Keys with a length greater than or equal to the length of the message offer perfect secrecy, where the ciphertext does not give any information about the plaintext or key.</p>
